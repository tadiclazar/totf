- This is a tactical, turn-based game. 
Nothing happens unless a player performs an action (moves, attacks, uses item, etc.), which means there is no reason to rush. 

- Take your time and avoid the fights you can't win.

- If you get in a room full of enemies, try to find an open, narrow passage from where you can fight them one at a time.

- Try to save as many healing potions as you can. They will appear less frequently in the later levels. 
Healing spell is weaker than a potion.

- You can mouse over items on the ground. Use this to check what certain items (or enemies) are. Many scrolls look the same, but they aren't.

- Balance out your character levels. 
Having more defense and HP at the start is a good idea, but zero resistance will make your life a living hell at higher dungeon levels.

- You get souls by killing enemies. Souls are used as currency and can be spent at merchants for items.
Check how much souls you have by pressing "c" key. Shopping is done by pressing "s" when near a merchant.

- Each body part corresponds to one equipment piece. Thus, you can't wear two chain mails, or two helmets, etc.

- Monsters at higher levels have more resistance. Use your mana wisely.

- The red dagger you get in dungeon level 19, if properly used, is the best item in the game.
Use it as you would any spellbook.
